## Landscape-level drivers of community bushmeat hunting over time

<br>

This repository contains code and data to reproduce the results (including figures) for the forthcoming paper, about to be submitted for peer review: *Landscape-level drivers of community bushmeat hunting over time*

To run the code, download the entire repository and run scripts within the R project. The 6 scripts need to be run in order for things to work (bmdr_1_kg, bmdr_2_offtake_p2, etc.)

To restore the project library locally onto your machine before running scripts (in case of issues using different package versions), begin by running the following command in the console: `renv::restore()`
